# VC Due Diligence: AI Browser Infrastructure Startups

## Objective

Build a knowledge base for a venture capital team evaluating the **AI browser infrastructure** space -- companies providing headless browsers, browser automation, and web interaction tools for AI agents.

The goal is to assess one target company's product, traction, competitive positioning, and funding status.


For the company "browser-use", the research should cover:

- **What they do**: Core product, key features, target users
- **Funding and team**: Known funding rounds, notable investors, team size and background
- **Traction signals**: GitHub stars, NPM downloads, community size, notable customers
- **Key Employees**: How they differentiate from others in the space

## Scope
This is a tiny scope test run. Keep it focused:
- **max 5 research tasks total**
- Keep prompts short and specific -- one clear question per task
